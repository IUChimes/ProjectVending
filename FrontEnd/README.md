# Notes

## PROS

* Has mocked JWT based auth
* Generally tidy structure, although non standard
* Separate `auth-header` function that includes necessary headers
* Set up basic router. (Redirect on auth failure)


## CONS

* Uses native `fetch` API instead of `axios` library.
* Everything is based on states
* Lots of duplicate code
Such as:
```
    loginFailure(state) {
        state.status = {};
        state.user = null;
    },
    logout(state) {
        state.status = {};
        state.user = null;
    },
```
